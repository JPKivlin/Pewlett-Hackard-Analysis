## Retirement and Mentorship Employee Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of employees retiring by title, and determine the employees that are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.

## Results
The results of the analysis are as follows:

1. The number of Senior staff of retirement age is nearly twice the number of the other titles combined [Senior Staff Count](Resources/senior_staff_count.png)
2. Only 2 managers will be retiring
3. There more than 90,000 employees that will be retiring
4. This company employ's a large number of people of 90k are retiring

## Summary
In summary, there are over 90,000 roles that will need to be filled if all eligible employees retire.  While there are nearly 2000 employees that fit the criteria for mentors, that does not seem to be enough to ensure a smooth transition after retirement.  In order to provide a more accurate analysis of the impact these retirements, a query identifying the number of employees that will need a mentor, and the total number of employees by title needing mentors would provide more insight into the "silver tsunami".
